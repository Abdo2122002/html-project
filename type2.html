        <h2 class="text3">About HTML:</h2>
        <p class="twxt2">
            A markup language used to create and design web pages and websites, and this language is considered one of the oldest and most widely used languages ​​in web page design.HTML is the language used to create files on the web, in which the structure and
            form of a web page is defined; That is, the form that the page looks like in addition to the special functions that it performs, and this is implemented through what is called tags, [2] This language also enables its users to create and structure
            sections, texts, titles, links and quotes for web pages, and it should be noted that it is not a programming language and that Because it does not enable its users to create dynamic functions, but rather its role is limited to organizing and
            coordinating texts, as is the case in some programs such as Microsoft Word.

        <h2 class="text3">About CSS:</h2>
        <p class="twxt2">
            CSS - short for Cascading Style Sheet - is a markup language that gives a website its beautiful look and unique design that will distinguish it from other sites. The CSS language is friendly to the HTML language, as it is always accompanying it and beside
            it in the design and creation of web pages. Both of these languages ​​form the basis of every website, HTML is the basis of all web page elements and CSS is the basis of the design and appearance of the site, without which websites would remain
            plain text on white backgrounds. Before CSS was started in 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), web pages were very limited and simple in form and function. Old browsers used to display web pages as pages consisting of black text with
            a white background only (text - images - links, etc.) without any design. There was no planning for the date of the launch of the CSS language.

        <h2 class="text3">About Python:</h2>
        <p class="twxt2">It is a high-level, easy-to-learn, open source, extensible, object-oriented programming language (OOP). Python is an interpreted, versatile language that is widely used in many fields, such as building independent programs using graphical interfaces
            and in web applications, and it can be used as a scripting language to control the performance of many programs such as Blender. In general, Python can be used to make simple programs for beginners, but also for large projects. It is often
            recommended for beginners in the field of programming to learn this language because it is among the fastest programming languages ​​to learn.

        <h2 class="text3">About Java:</h2>
        <p class="twxt2">It is an object-oriented programming language, created by James Gosling in 1992 while working in the laboratories of Sun Microsystems, to use it as the thinking mind used to operate smart application devices such as interactive television, and
            the Java language was a development of C++, and when it was born, its creator called it "Oak" meaning the oak tree; And it is the tree that he was seeing from his office window while working at Sun Microsystems Laboratories, then the name
            changed to Java, and this name (unusually in naming programming languages) is not the first letters of the words of a specific sentence or expression with a certain meaning, but it is just a name put by the developers of these language to
            compete with other names.

        <h2 class="text3">About Java script:</h2>
        <p class="twxt2">JavaScript or JS for short is a high-level programming language used primarily in web browsers to create more interactive pages. It is currently being developed by Mozilla Corporation. The JavaScript language was intended for amateur and non-professional
            programmers, but increased interest in it and attracted the interest of professional programmers after adding new technologies such as the spread of AJAX technology, which led to a speed in the interaction between the server and the client.
            JavaScript is used to create interactive web pages and to provide web applications including games; It is used by the majority of sites, and is supported by almost all browsers without the need for third-party add-ons
