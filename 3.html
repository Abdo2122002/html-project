        <h2 class="TEXT"> Programming:
            <BR> Something somewhat intangible compared to other products,
            <BR> a series of thousands or millions of commands that ask a computer to perform certain operations such as displaying information,
            <BR> performing calculations, or storing data.
            <BR> This software is like the soul of the body in the computer system
            <BR>and it is constantly expanding and increasing in complexity, requirements and tasks that it performs.
            <BR>
            <BR>
            <BR>
            <BR> As for software engineering:
            <BR>it is a branch of engineering based on a set of foundations and rules aimed at designing and developing programs in abundance and high quality that meet the needs of users.
            <BR>It is not enough to find good integrated software the work of one person, but it requires a team of good engineers.
            <BR> It was necessary to find a science concerned with software engineering to lay the foundations and standards that protect this profession from intruders so
            <BR> that it is possible to distinguish good software from bad ones, and software verification in software project management, software testing and software engineering,
            <BR> as well as to indicate the audit mechanism that the software project conforms to the specified specifications and that it It works the way expected.
            <BR> The term may also be used to control program quality. Usually,
            <BR> this task is one of the tasks of the software engineer who performs the software testing process,
            <BR> as part of the software life cycle processes, </h2>
