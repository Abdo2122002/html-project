            <h2 class="he">Define of c:</h2>
            it is a language used in programming a computer or any machine that contains a processor or a micro-controller. It is a simple and flexible programming language used for general purposes. It is also a structured and machine-independent language that is
            widely used in various applications that have been pre-programmed in assembly language: Like many application programs for computers, operating systems and embedded systems. Read more on e3arabi: What do you know about the C programming language.
            C is a basic language necessary for writing all operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Unix), to complex programs such as Oracle database, Python interpreter, and others. C is a multipurpose language, an imperative language that helps
            support structural programming, self-recalling, and the pronunciation of variable code. </p>

            <H2 class="he">Reasons to use C programming language:
            </H2>here are two main reasons why programmers use the C language and write their programs in it: The first reason: the flexibility of this language and giving it the freedom to act for the programmer. The second reason is that many operating
            systems are written in them. Read more on e3arabi: What do you know about the C programming language? https://e3arabi.com/?p=323462</p>

            <H2 class="he">c.language renewal: </H2>
            The language dates back to 1979, and was created by Brian Stroustrup while working at Bell Laboratories. In fact, he worked on it as an upgraded version of C, initially called C with classes, and 99% of C programs were running on it without changing the
            source code. The name of the language was changed in 1983 to the current name C++ (indicating the language's increment factor of ++). With time, many features were added until it developed and reached its current popularity.

            <H2 class="he">pros and cons of C++: </H2>pros::As a result of the attention that the language has received since its inception, it has been distinguished from its predecessor by many advantages that made it a prestigious language among its peers. We will
            mention some of its advantages:<br>1-Object-oriented language.
            <br>2-portable.
            <br>3- Multitasking.<br>4-Inclusive.<br>5- Powerful as it is used in many operating systems.<br>6- It is considered one of the leading languages ​​for developing large and complex projects.<br>7- It inherited the advantages of C but added
            many important programming patterns, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and classes.<br>8- It provided many functions associated with functions and overloading.<br> 9-Provides a standard STL library of algorithms
            and I/O. units.<br>cons::No language is without some weaknesses or perhaps minor flaws, so we must note them:<br>1- C++ language is considered unsafe.<br>2- Complex for the new learner. <br>3-Difficult to handle and debug when used in web
            applications. <br>4-Resource recovery does not support Garbage collection.<br>5- It does not provide much support for the programmer.<br>6- There are no default libraries of their own for designing graphical interfaces.

            <H2 class="he">c#: </H2>C# should be simple, modern, general-purpose, and object-oriented. The language and investigation should also provide support for software engineering principles such as strong pattern checking (or static validation), array bounds
            checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection. As well as emphasizing the importance of robustness and durability of software and programmer productivity. The design must enable the language
            to be used to develop software components that are usable in distributed environments.The portability of the source code is a very important goal, as is the portability of the programmer, especially for those who are experienced with C++ and
            C. Supporting localization and globalization is a goal of high importance. C# should be suitable for programming applications specific to both embedded and host systems, whether they are large applications using complex operating systems or
            simple applications with limited functionality. Although applications written in C# should conserve memory and processing power, the language is not intended to directly compete with the performance and size of applications written in C or
            assembly language.<br>C# has a more secure profiling than C++. The implicit transformations that are available by default in the language are those that are exclusively secure. Like expanding integers (from Int16 to Int32 for example). This
            policy is implemented during compilation, during translation in time (JIT), and sometimes during execution. There is no implicit conversion between Boolean and Integer nor between members of enumerated and integer styles (except for the 0
            character which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated style). Any user-defined transformation must be indicated explicitly or implicitly in a way that violates the C++ compiler Objects and transform operators that work implicitly by
            default.
